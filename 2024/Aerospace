# Solution to the Problem

If two distinct non-zero real variables \( x \) and \( y \) are such that \( (x + y) \) is proportional to \( (x - y) \), there exists a constant \( k \) such that:

\[
x + y = k(x - y)
\]

We need to determine the value of \( \frac{x}{y} \).

---

## Step 1: Express the Equation
Start with the proportionality relation:
\[
x + y = k(x - y)
\]

Expand both sides:
\[
x + y = kx - ky
\]

---

## Step 2: Rearrange Terms
Rearrange the equation to group \( x \)-terms and \( y \)-terms:
\[
x - kx = -ky - y
\]

Factorize:
\[
x(1 - k) = y(-1 - k)
\]

---

## Step 3: Solve for \( \frac{x}{y} \)
Divide both sides by \( y(1 - k) \) (note \( y \neq 0 \) and \( k \neq 1 \)):
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{-1 - k}{1 - k}
\]

---

## Step 4: Interpret the Solution
The value of \( \frac{x}{y} \) depends only on \( k \), the proportionality constant.

1. Since \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct and non-zero, \( k \) cannot make \( \frac{x}{y} \) undefined.
2. \( k = 1 \) is excluded because it would imply \( x + y = x - y \), leading to \( y = 0 \), which contradicts the problem's conditions.

Thus, the final value of \( \frac{x}{y} \) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{x}{y} = \frac{-1 - k}{1 - k}}
\]
